#Spark Android SDK

This open-source SDK library enables you to easily integrate the Spark 3D printing API into your Android applications. See our <a href="https://spark.autodesk.com/developers/features/" target="_blank">Features page</a> for a list of the possibilities available with the Spark API.

<b>Spark APIs are current in beta: [Request access](https://spark.autodesk.com/developers/).</b>

This Android SDK supports all Spark Authentication, Drive and Print API calls, providing capabilities such as storing 3D objects in the Spark Cloud, preparing files for printing and submitting them to a printer.

##Getting Started

Download this repository and import it into your project.

The Spark Android SDK comes with a sample app, located in the library’s App folder.

To use the Spark Android SDK you must first <i>add an app</i> on the [Spark Developer’s Portal](https://spark.autodesk.com/developers/myApps) and save the app key and app secret Spark generates. For more information see [the tutorial](https://spark.autodesk.com/developers/reference/software-developers/tutorials/register-an-app).

##Setting Up the SDK

##1. Initialization

Call the init method passing the app key and app secret allocated by the [developer portal](https://spark.autodesk.com/developers/myApps):
```JavaScript
Spark.init(this, [APPKEY], [APPSECRET],[ENV_TYPE]);
```
Enable debug mode to see logcat messages regarding your configuration and any error messages or notifications.<br>
```JavaScript
Spark.setDebugMode(true);
```

##2. Authentication

Spark API use OAUTH 2.0 authentication.<br>
There are two types of authentication available:<br>
* Guest Token - For read only permissions. Gives you access to public data on Spark.
* Access Token - For read\write access to a Spark member’s private data. Access Tokens log the user in from your app.

###2.1 Generate a Guest Token

```JavaScript
       SparkAuthentication.getGuestToken(new ISparkResponse<AccessTokenResponse>() {
            @Override
            public void onSparkSuccess(AccessTokenResponse responseObject) {
                ((EditText) 
			
             // Success !
             // Call Spark API
            }

            @Override
            public void onSparkFailure(String errorMessage) {
	        // Failure
            // Check error message
            }
        });
```

###2.2  Get Access Token
```JavaScript
       SparkAuthentication.getAuthorizationCode(getActivity(),new ISparkResponse<AccessTokenResponse>() {
            @Override
            public void onSparkSuccess(AccessTokenResponse responseObject) {
            // Success !
	        // Call Spark API
           }
            @Override
            public void onSparkFailure(String errorMessage) {
            // Failure
            // Check error message
            }
            });
```

##3. Spark API Call Example

###3.1 Get Asset by ID
```JavaScript
SparkDrive.getAsset(new AssetRequest([ASSET_ID]), new ISparkResponse<AssetResponse>() {<br>

            @Override 
            public void onSparkSuccess(AssetResponse responseObject) { 
            }
            @Override<br>
            public void onSparkFailure(String errorMessage) { 
             } 
             }); 
```
##4. List of the Spark API Available in the SDK

###4.1 Authentication API
```JavaScript
      SparkAuthentication.getGuestToken(...); 
      SparkAuthentication.getAuthorizationCode(..); 
```
The Authentication API authenticates users and apps and provides access to the Spark API. 
Autentication API documentation: https://spark.autodesk.com/developers/reference/api/authentication.

###4.2 Drive API
```JavaScript     
     SparkDrive.createAsset(...); 
     SparkDrive.createFile(...); 
     SparkDrive.getAsset(...); 
     SparkDrive.getMemberAssets(...); 
     SparkDrive.getCurrentMember(...); 
     SparkDrive.getAssets(...); 
     SparkDrive.getMember(...); 
```

The Drive API stores 3D models and their files, uploads files for printing, provides social network services such as “like” of members, “favorite” models and attaches comments to models. 
Drive API Documentation: https://spark.autodesk.com/developers/reference/api/drive.

###4.3 Printer API
```JavaScript
       SparkPrint.createJob(...); 
       SparkPrint.jobStatus(...); 
       SparkPrint.commandSend(...); 
       SparkPrint.registerPrinter(...); 
       SparkPrint.unregisterPrinter(...);
```

Spark Print API heals and prepares 3D models for printing, registers 3D printers for use, sends commands and 3D print jobs to 3D printers and monitors printer progress.
Print API Documentation: https://spark.autodesk.com/developers/reference/api/print.
